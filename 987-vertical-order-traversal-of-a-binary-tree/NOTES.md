We are just inserting the values stored in multiset (multiset is in the map "nodes") into our vector named "col" . This is done according to the question return requirement. ".insert()" function is used to add the values in vector. It's parameter are ".insert(position, iterator1, iterator2)". Here, 1st we are specifying the position where we need to add the values, and then we specified the starting position of the DS from which values need to be inserted, then "i.second.end()" means the end position of the values till which will be added. :)
